                                README



  This module is implemented using the built-in MarkLogic's HTTP
Client functions (xdmp:http-get(), xdmp:http-post() and so on...)
Support is not fully complete because of differences between those
functions and this EXPath module.  I will write a precise list of what
is supported and what is not.  Fell free to ask on the mailing list if
you want more details; in the meanwhile, the source of the module
contains useful comments.

  To install the EXPath module, you just have to put it in you
MarkLogic Server instance, like any other XQuery module.  That depends
on how you configured you document database (queries can be put on the
filesystem or on a dedicated queries database.)  See the MarkLogic
documentation for details.

  If you need any assistance, please join and ask on the EXPath
mailing list <http://expath.org/lists.html>.
